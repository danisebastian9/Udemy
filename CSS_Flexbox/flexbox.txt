Flexbox is intended for one line 
(1column 1 row) tables. 
It's going to work as grid but with a more
dedicated path by not having multiple boxes the
same size, but having each box at its own proper and needed
space. 

columns are not going to be aligned between them.

* "flex-direction: " will manage the way the data is displayed
    through the flexbox.
